	<h1>Camelids</h1>
	<p>The four llamas and two camels are camlids tend too be large and are strictly behaviourous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways.
	they have a three-chambered rather than the four chambereddigestive tract; an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile ,
	and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. they have long legs that, because they lacktensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,
	look longer still (from Wikipedia)
